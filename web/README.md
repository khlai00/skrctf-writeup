# Writeups For Web Challenges

## Secret URL
I got this website from my friend, but I have no idea where is the secret page. Can you find the secret page?

It says mr.robot knows where is the flag. No its not referring to Elliot, its referring to **robots.txt**

If you dont know what is **robots.txt**, take a look at this https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots.txt/

Lets try to see if there is anything in **robots.txt**

It seems that this is the secret url. Enter the URL `https://skrctf.me/ports/4000//3aaec0a26f2a63d6ff3dfcfbf8e7902a.html` to get the flag.


## Kuki Cookies
Can you find where is my secret cookies?

This is obviously has something to do with cookies.
Lets take a look at the cookies generated by this webpage.

Looking at the data, it seems like it is encoded with URL Encoding because there are % symbols.

**SKR%7BI_L0v35_C00k13ssss%21_02f627%7D**

Decode it with URL Decoding and you will get the flag.



## Kuki Cookies 2
How to get the flag with the cookies?

This is another cookie challenge, but there is a button. Once cliked it says **only admin can get the flag**!

Looking at the cookies again we can see that the value for the admin cookie is **false**.

Lets try to change the value to **true**.

Click on the button again and you will get the flag.
