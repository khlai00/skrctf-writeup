# Writeups For Web Challenges

## My First SQL
I made a website with login using PHP and MySQL! Feel free to try it.

There is a login page which requires a username & password.

This is a SQL Injection challenge. Take a look at [this](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) to understand more about SQLi.

We can use a basic SQLi payload to bypass this login page. `' or ''='`

How this works is that once the SQLi code is injected. A valid SQL statement like this will be created at the database server.
>  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""=""

This SQL statement will return all rows from the Users table because **OR ""=""** will always be true.

You will get the flag once the SQLi code in injected.



## My First XSS
I created a website that users can leave comments for fun. Feel free to try it!

This is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) challenge. Take a look at [this](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) to understand more about XSS.

There is a input field in the Add Comment section. Since we dont know what kinds of function we should be executing, lets take a look at the source code to find some clues.

It says trigger the alert function to get the flag. Lets try triggering an alert function with `<script>alert("")</script>` in the input field.

## Secret URL
I got this website from my friend, but I have no idea where is the secret page. Can you find the secret page?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135821737-75a82740-f4ec-4108-84cd-c5c59d6b1add.png)

It says mr.robot knows where is the flag. No its not referring to Elliot, its referring to **robots.txt**

If you dont know what is **robots.txt**, take a look at [this](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots.txt/)

Lets try to see if there is anything in **robots.txt**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135822723-0a8a1690-c29e-45ec-90f3-2b6037c0c03c.png)

It seems that this is the secret url. Enter the URL `https://skrctf.me/ports/4000/3aaec0a26f2a63d6ff3dfcfbf8e7902a.html` to get the flag.



## Kuki Cookies
Can you find where is my secret cookies?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135816272-e74a08b9-a192-4906-887e-bc6497e89da3.png)

This is obviously has something to do with cookies.
Lets take a look at the cookies generated by this webpage.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135819195-72df6c94-4c7d-4502-964d-4149ec6ae956.png)

Looking at the data, it seems like it is encoded with URL Encoding because there are % symbols.

> **SKR%7BI_L0v35_C00k13ssss%21_02f627%7D**

Decode it with URL Decoding and you will get the flag.




## Kuki Cookies 2
How to get the flag with the cookies?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135817592-da23ae60-f0e7-4d39-a792-877e3e39f250.png)

This is another cookie challenge, but there is a button. Once clicked it says **only admin can get the flag**!

Looking at the cookies again we can see that the value for the admin cookie is **false**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57955404/135819780-83de7867-78fa-44cf-9bdc-24925988066b.png)

Lets try to change the value to **true**.

Click on the button again and you will get the flag.



## SQL Service
Check out my SQL Service website!

This is another SQL Injection challenge.

Use the SQLi payload from [*My First SQL*](README.md#my-first-sql) to get the flag.
