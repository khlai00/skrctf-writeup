This is obviously has something to do with cookies.
Lets take a look at the cookies generated by this webpage.

Looking at the data, it seems like it is encoded with URL Encoding because there are % symbols.

**SKR%7BI_L0v35_C00k13ssss%21_02f627%7D**

Decode it with URL Decoding and you will get the flag.

This is another cookie challenge, but there is a button. Once cliked it says **only admin can get the flag**!

Looking at the cookies again we can see that the value for the admin cookie is **false**.

Lets try to change the value to **true**.

Click on the button again and you will get the flag.
